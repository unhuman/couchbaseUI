Build: mvn install
Run: java -jar target/CouchbaseUI-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT-shade.jar

Developer Notes:
Earlier there were problems with making the build work properly with Java 11 and lambdas with the ideauidesigner-maven-plugin.
This has been resolved by setting the IntelliJ GUI designer to output Java source code instead of Binary class files.
